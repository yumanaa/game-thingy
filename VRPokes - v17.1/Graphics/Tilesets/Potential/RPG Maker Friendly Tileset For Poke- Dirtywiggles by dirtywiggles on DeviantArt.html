                <div class="text block">This is the 5.0 version I was promising. Redid some tiles, made some of my own tiles for this one. As you can see this one eliminates a lot of the "useless tiles" found in the others as well as has a building style indecision at the end. Either way this will work for any Gen 4-5 style game you may need. It has perfect aligning and leaves space to throw in your own tiles right over it if you want to. It should be an easy plug in to any game and is intended for RPG maker XP. Also, you should be able to substitute it for my previous ones with minimal change in important tiles minus buildings. <br>Credits are the same as before. This is for public use and all can use it. I would just like a note or comment so I can see what people are doing with it for fun. Heavy credits to calis, minorthreat0987, dewitty, and many of the others listed before. Many of the tiles are not made by me and they do some amazing work. I hope this can help a lot of people make the games they want. It helps me make mine, Pokemon Primal and thought I should share for those who do not want to make a tileset. If anyone finds any good buildings please send them so I can make this tileset the best it can be. You would be helping everyone else too. My intention is to have the most complete and balanced tileset on the market.&nbsp;</div>
